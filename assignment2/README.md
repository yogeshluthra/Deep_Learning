## Experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset using:
- Fully connected Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Batch Normalization
- Drop Out
- New Optimization Algorithm
- Modifications to Batch Normalization to consider Cumulative Moving Averages of Mean and Variances rather than Exponential Moving Averages.

This project is completely implemented using Python, Scipy and Matplotlib libraries. Also all evaluations are done on my Macbook, so runs slower compared to GPU based machines.
Thus networks are not very deep.
